TODO:

Possibly move the action listeners in Gameplay to seperate classes
DOCUMENT EVERYTHING/change bad variable names 
 -----Classes and methods are javadoc'd to explain to other 
 developers how to use classes and methods. Blocks of code 
 are documented as needed to explain what the code is 
 accomplishing and how.
 
 Good and consistent use of indentation, white space 
 and blocking of related code.  Naming of variables, 
 classes and methods and avoidance of magic numbers make 
 code easy to read. Conditions, statements and expressions 
 are easy to understand and minimal nesting of statement 
 makes code easy to read.-----
